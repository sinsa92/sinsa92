### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Yes, I know. My profile and repos are pretty empty. This is because I mainly work with GitLab. This account only exists for other GitHub projects where I create issues or merge requests.

To find out more about my personal projects I work on, head over to https://gitlab.com/sinsa
